## MyArrayList
 
 it's my custom dynamic array list 

---


# Features
- Generic type of my Array list
- add elements
- remove elements
- convert to array

# Usage
you can check all of methods in 'Mylist' interface, and for deep understanding of methods logic you can check 'MyArrayList' class   



---

## MyLinkedList

It's my custom doubly-linked list implementation.

---

# Features
- Generic type support (`T extends Comparable<T>`)
- Doubly linked structure (each node has `next` and `previous`)
- Add elements at the beginning, end, or specific index
- Remove elements by index, from beginning or end
- Search for elements (`exists`, `indexOf`, `lastIndexOf`)
- Modify elements (`set`)
- Get elements by index, first, or last
- Sort elements (bubble sort based on `Comparable`)
- Convert to array (`toArray`)
- Clear all elements
- Get current size

---

# Usage

You can find all method declarations in the `MyList<T>` interface.  
For implementation details and logic, check the `MyLinkedList<T>` class.

Supports generic data types that implement `Comparable`, e.g., `Integer`, `String`, `Double`, etc.
